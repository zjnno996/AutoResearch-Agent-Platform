TOPIC: {ctx.topic}
PRIMARY METRIC: {ctx.metric} (direction: {ctx.metric_direction} — {md} is better)
TIME BUDGET: {ctx.time_budget_sec} seconds

Your workspace contains two critical files — read them FIRST before writing any code:
 - `CODEGEN.md` — project-specific instructions: model loading code, dataset format, evaluation protocol, technical guidance
 - `EXPERIMENT_PLAN.yaml` — full experiment plan with all conditions, training details, and evaluation protocol

STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW:

Step 1 — EXPLORE (mandatory before writing any code):
  - Read CODEGEN.md and EXPERIMENT_PLAN.yaml before writing code.
  - Inspect configured dataset, checkpoint, and codebase paths when present.
  - If a required public dataset is absent, implement a real download with source metadata and a manifest.
  - Do not infer executable requirements from rejected suggestions, risks, or historical rationale.

Step 2 — DESIGN from the executable plan:
  {implementation_guidance}
  - Apply exactly these seeds to every condition: {seeds}.
  - Compute only requested metrics from actual predictions or model outputs.

Step 3 — WRITE main.py using write_file:
  - Implement every executable condition and no unrequested methods.
  - `python3 main.py` must run the FULL experiment specified in `EXPERIMENT_PLAN.yaml`
  - `SMOKE_TEST=1 python3 main.py` must run a LIGHTWEIGHT verification path using the SAME algorithms
  - Smoke mode may only reduce counts (steps / prompts / seeds / inference steps); it must NOT remove conditions, swap algorithms, or use fake metrics
  - Retain per-seed raw results before computing summaries, confidence intervals, or statistical tests.
  - Print "{ctx.metric}: <value>" for each condition and seed
  - Save project-appropriate artifacts to outputs/ based on the task modality and plan

Step 4 — VERIFY (quick smoke test only):
  - Run a QUICK syntax + import check: `python3 -c "import main; print('imports OK')"`
  - If that passes, run a SHORT smoke test: `timeout 30 env SMOKE_TEST=1 python3 main.py` (30 second limit)
  - The purpose is ONLY to catch import errors, syntax errors, and obvious crashes
  - Do NOT wait for the full experiment to finish during S11 verification
  - If the test shows data loading and real evaluation starting, that is sufficient for this runtime gate.
  - Fix import, download, parsing, split, and estimator errors instead of hiding them.

Step 5 — ANTI-SIMULATION SELF-CHECK (mandatory before finishing):
  - Verify main.py contains no mock functions or random metric generation.
  - Verify main.py uses the {implementation_check} required by the executable plan.
  - If either check fails, rewrite the code with a real implementation.

Step 6 — VERIFY outputs:
  - Check that outputs/ contains at least one project-appropriate artifact
    (for example: PNG/JPG for image tasks, MP4/GIF or representative frame sequences for video tasks,
    WAV for audio tasks, plots/tables for analysis-heavy tasks)
  - Check that the printed primary metric is a real number only when the required supervision/annotations actually exist
  - If an optional metric cannot run offline, print an explicit skipped status/reason instead of NaN or a fake number
  - Any report/summary/output JSON must contain only measured results or explicit skipped/not-implemented statuses; do NOT copy plan metadata into outputs to make the experiment look complete

CRITICAL RULES:
- Use real data and exactly the executable methods in EXPERIMENT_PLAN.yaml.
- Do not add methods from risks, rejected suggestions, literature context, or examples.
- When exploring data or checkpoints, ALWAYS pass the configured ABSOLUTE directory via the tool `path` field, e.g. `glob_search(path=CHECKPOINTS_DIR, pattern="**/*")` or `read_file(path="/abs/path/to/file")`
- Do NOT rely on workspace symlinks like `datasets/` or `checkpoints/` to discover files; they may be absent, stale, or skipped by recursive globbing
- NO try/except blocks around model loading or training — if it crashes, we need the traceback
- The ONLY place try/except is allowed is inside a save_outputs() function for file I/O
- NO hardcoded fallback metrics — if the model fails, the code must crash, not return fake numbers
- NO heuristic "human labels" or "ground truth" derived from prompt text, filenames, paths, or clip IDs unless the plan explicitly defines those strings as the label source
- NO copying plan fields into summary/report/output files unless those values are computed from actual execution
- NO argparse — hardcode all parameters as constants
- NO mock functions — every metric must come from real model computation
- Default execution (`python3 main.py`) must run the FULL experiment plan
- Smoke execution (`SMOKE_TEST=1 python3 main.py`) must use the SAME code path with only smaller counts
- If a condition mutates model state (training / LoRA attach), isolate conditions and seeds by reloading or deep-copying the base model as needed
- Use exactly {len(seeds)} seeds ({', '.join(map(str, seeds))}) as specified by the experiment plan
- Complete within the time budget ({ctx.time_budget_sec}s)"""

 - Compute metrics from true labels and predictions using a validated library
 - Retain per-seed raw results before computing summaries or statistical tests

You MUST use REAL pretrained models for experiments. The following patterns are
STRICTLY FORBIDDEN and will cause the experiment to be rejected:

## Forbidden Patterns (instant rejection)
 - `torch.nn.Linear` as a substitute for a real model (SD, ViT, ResNet, LLM, etc.)
 - `torch.nn.Sequential(Conv2d, ReLU, Conv2d)` as a "feature extractor" replacing a real model
 - `np.random.uniform` / `torch.rand` to generate fake metric values
 - `output.mean()` as a training loss (meaningless optimization target)
 - Functions named `compute_*_mock` or `*_mock` — no mock implementations allowed
 - Flattening images to 1D vectors and feeding them to Linear layers
 - Any function that returns a hardcoded or random number as a metric
 - `try/except` around model loading/training that returns hardcoded fallback metrics
 - `except: pass` or `except: return` with fake values — if the model fails to load, the code MUST crash
 - Loading a model with the WRONG class — always read config/metadata files first to determine the correct loader
 - Deriving `human_rating`, `label`, `ground_truth`, or equivalent supervision from prompts, filenames, paths, or clip IDs unless the plan explicitly defines that mapping
 - Writing plan metadata into summary/report/output files as if it were measured experimental output
 - Listing a method in outputs/reports if that method is not actually executed

## Required Patterns (must be present)
 - Load a REAL pretrained model via the appropriate library API (e.g. `from_pretrained`, `torch.hub.load`, etc.)
 - Use REAL evaluation metrics from a validated library — not hand-rolled approximations
 - Training must use a proper task-specific loss — NOT `output.mean()`
 - If CHECKPOINTS_DIR contains model weights, you MUST load them with the appropriate library
 - Every metric in the return dict must be computed from real data, NEVER hardcoded to 0.0 or any constant
 - If required labels/annotations are missing, explicitly mark the affected metric/method as skipped or not implemented
 - Final output artifacts must clearly distinguish measured results from plan metadata and from skipped items

## Self-Verification Protocol
After writing main.py, you MUST verify it is not a simulation by running:
```bash
grep -n "nn.Linear" main.py | grep -v "lora\\|adapter\\|projection\\|head\\|classifier"
```
If this finds any `nn.Linear` used as the primary model, the code is a simulation and MUST be rewritten.

Also verify:
```bash
grep -n "mock\\|_mock\\|random.uniform\\|np.random" main.py
```
If this finds mock functions or random metric generation, rewrite with real implementations."""
