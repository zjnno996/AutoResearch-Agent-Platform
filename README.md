## 🤔 What Is This?

**Claw AI Lab** is a lab-native multi-agent research platform for interactive and scalable AI-driven science. It enables users to create a full AI research lab from a single prompt, with customizable roles, research directions, and collaborative workflows, rather than relying on a single-agent or fixed serial pipeline. Claw orchestrates multiple agents and projects in parallel through a FIFO-based scheduling framework, maximizing compute utilization while supporting cross-project knowledge sharing and mutual improvement. Crucially, the system keeps humans in the loop: users can intervene whenever needed, provide feedback under ambiguity, inject new ideas, and iteratively refine the research process through rollback and continuation. Combined with a simple UI that reduces everything to prompts and clicks, Claw transforms automated research into a more intuitive, steerable, and laboratory-like experience.

### 🏆 Discussion Mode Showcase

Multi-agent discussion on: **"What is the most deployable direction for Video Action Models in Embodied AI?"**

> **Agent A** — World Model + MPC (Model Predictive Control) is the most industrially stable path.
>
> **Agent B** — "Train with video, infer with action" is the most deployable policy paradigm.
>
> **Agent C** — Execution monitoring & SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) automation lands fastest as a product.

**Consensus:** The most deployable form is not a single end-to-end model, but a **layered, modular system** — use video supervision during training to learn rich dynamics, output actions directly at inference for low latency, and layer planning/MPC/safety modules on top for closed-loop robustness and recovery.

<details>
<summary><b>Top 3 Research Directions (ranked by deployability)</b></summary>

| # | Direction | Deployability |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Layered Video-Action Stack** — video-action joint training + direct action inference + MPC safety | Highest — best balance of latency, interpretability & safety |
| 2 | **Video-to-Plan / SOP** — demo videos → step sequences & skill graphs for existing robots | High — smallest embodiment gap, clearest commercial path |
| 3 | **Execution Monitor** — real-time step tracking, anomaly detection, re-planning triggers | High — fastest to production; critical for industrial reliability |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Key Contradictions Resolved</b></summary>

| Debate | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- |
| World Model + MPC vs. Direct Action? | **Combine both** — world model for representation, direct action for control, MPC for safety |
| Human video: valuable or too much gap? | **Pre-training yes**; direct low-level transfer not yet reliable |
| Is monitoring a "real" action model? | Not the backbone, but **fastest to reach production value** |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Claw-AI-Lab/Claw-AI-Lab.git
cd Claw-AI-Lab

# Create python environment
conda create -n clawailab python=3.11
conda activate clawailab

# Backend
cd backend/agent
pip install -e ".[all]"
pip install websockets

# Frontend
cd ../../frontend
npm install

## 💡 Tips to Get the Best Results

| # | Recommendation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Prepare local codebases, datasets & checkpoints** — enter their paths when submitting a project | Avoids download delays and network failures during runs |
| 2 | **Use a strong coding model like GPT 5.4** | Significantly better code quality and fewer iteration cycles |
| 3 | **Review the `IMPORTANT` fields in [Configuration Details](#️-configuration-details)** | Misconfigured API keys or resource limits are the #1 cause of failed runs |
